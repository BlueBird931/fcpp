To build the test application, you'll need:
	* MinGW-w64 8.1.0
	* CMake 3.9 (or higher)

After setting the respective environmental variables, go into the ./fcpp directory through a prompt and type the following commands:
	* cmake -S ./ -B ./build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
	* cmake --build ./build/

Wait the application to be built.
